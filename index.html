            <h2>Story 1: “The Whispering Fog”</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>When Eliza inherited the crumbling seaside cottage from her estranged aunt, she saw it as a fresh start. Marrows
                Edge was small, remote, and beautiful — perfect for escaping the noise of her old life.
                But from the moment she arrived, the locals stared at her with hollow eyes, speaking in hushed tones.
                "Stay inside after dark," the old grocer warned. "When the fog comes, don't listen to it."
                Eliza brushed off the warnings as local superstition. The first few days were peaceful, though at night, dense
                fog would roll in from the sea, thicker than anything she'd ever seen. It clung to the house like a living
                thing.
                One night, unable to sleep, she walked to the window. The fog swirled outside like ghostly dancers. Then she
                heard it—soft, melodic whispers. At first, she thought it was the wind, but soon the voices grew clearer.
                "Eliza..." they cooed. "Why do you hide? We ve been waiting for you..."
                The whispers came from every corner, inside her head, vibrating in her bones. The air grew icy. Breath misted
                from her lips. She closed the curtains, but the voices only grew louder, more urgent, more seductive.
                "You belong here, Eliza."
                That night, the power went out. The fog slipped through cracks and keyholes, coiling like ghostly tendrils. In
                the dim candlelight, Eliza saw shapes forming — pale, elongated faces with hollow eyes and gaping mouths.
                Then the knocking started.
                It came from every wall, every window, every door — a frantic rhythm like dozens of skeletal fists pounding. She
                backed into a corner, clutching a kitchen knife. The whispers crescendoed into an eerie chant.
                "One of us... one of us... one of us..."
                Suddenly, the front door creaked open on its own. Through the blinding fog stepped a tall, thin figure in a
                tattered dress — her aunt. But her eyes were gone, and from her open mouth issued a chorus of voices.
                "Welcome home, child."
                Eliza screamed, but the fog closed in like a living shroud, pulling her into its cold embrace.
                The next morning, the cottage stood empty. The fog had retreated, but now, the locals whispered of another lost
                soul claimed by the Whispering Fog.</p>
