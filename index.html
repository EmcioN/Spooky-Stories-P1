            <h2>“The Whispering Fog”</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>When Eliza inherited the crumbling seaside cottage from her estranged aunt, she saw it as a fresh start. Marrows
                Edge was small, remote, and beautiful — perfect for escaping the noise of her old life.
                But from the moment she arrived, the locals stared at her with hollow eyes, speaking in hushed tones.
                "Stay inside after dark," the old grocer warned. "When the fog comes, don't listen to it."
                Eliza brushed off the warnings as local superstition. The first few days were peaceful, though at night, dense
                fog would roll in from the sea, thicker than anything she'd ever seen. It clung to the house like a living
                thing.
                One night, unable to sleep, she walked to the window. The fog swirled outside like ghostly dancers. Then she
                heard it—soft, melodic whispers. At first, she thought it was the wind, but soon the voices grew clearer.
                "Eliza..." they cooed. "Why do you hide? We ve been waiting for you..."
                The whispers came from every corner, inside her head, vibrating in her bones. The air grew icy. Breath misted
                from her lips. She closed the curtains, but the voices only grew louder, more urgent, more seductive.
                "You belong here, Eliza."
                That night, the power went out. The fog slipped through cracks and keyholes, coiling like ghostly tendrils. In
                the dim candlelight, Eliza saw shapes forming — pale, elongated faces with hollow eyes and gaping mouths.
                Then the knocking started.
                It came from every wall, every window, every door — a frantic rhythm like dozens of skeletal fists pounding. She
                backed into a corner, clutching a kitchen knife. The whispers crescendoed into an eerie chant.
                "One of us... one of us... one of us..."
                Suddenly, the front door creaked open on its own. Through the blinding fog stepped a tall, thin figure in a
                tattered dress — her aunt. But her eyes were gone, and from her open mouth issued a chorus of voices.
                "Welcome home, child."
                Eliza screamed, but the fog closed in like a living shroud, pulling her into its cold embrace.
                The next morning, the cottage stood empty. The fog had retreated, but now, the locals whispered of another lost
                soul claimed by the Whispering Fog.</p>

            <h2>“The Collector of Shadows”</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Miles had worked at the Hargrove Museum for almost a year before he became curious about the forbidden section
                known only as the Shadow Gallery.
        
                The old caretaker, Mr. Penrose, gave strict orders:
                "Stay out of that room, lad. You dont want to wake what sleeps inside."
        
                But temptation gnawed at Miles like a worm inside an apple. Why was it locked? Why were there no records of its
                contents? On one particularly stormy night, lightning illuminated the corridor as the power flickered. The
                Shadow Gallery door stood slightly ajar.
        
                Miles hesitated — then stepped inside.
        
                The room smelled of mildew and decay. Dozens of glass jars lined the walls, each swirling with thick, black
                vapor that seemed to move with intelligence. A chill crawled across his skin as the door closed behind him with
                a loud click.
        
                In the center stood an enormous mirror framed in rusted iron. But the reflection it cast was not his own.
                Instead, a gaunt, hollow-eyed version of himself stood inside, grinning with jagged teeth.
        
                "Welcome," the reflection hissed.
        
                The jars trembled. The shadows inside began to shriek, releasing distorted echoes of human voices — some
                pleading, some cackling, some weeping. The air grew heavy, dense with invisible weight.
        
                Suddenly, long, skeletal fingers pressed from the inside of the mirror's surface, and the reflection stepped out
                into the room. Miles tried to run, but his feet wouldn't move. The shadows surged like liquid smoke, swirling
                around him, binding his arms and legs.
        
                "The Collector has been waiting, Miles. A new vessel... a new soul..."
        
                His own shadow tore free from his feet and joined the others, wrapping around him like a cocoon. He felt his
                memories slipping, his identity dissolving into the inky cloud. His last scream was muffled as his mouth filled
                with cold, creeping darkness.
        
                The next morning, the museum was quiet. Mr. Penrose entered the Shadow Gallery to find a new jar added to the
                collection — this one swirling violently, with a faint outline of Miles horrified face trapped within.
        
                The Collector had claimed another.</p>

            <h2>“The Cursed Tape”</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>At a small estate sale in an abandoned neighborhood, Amelia stumbled upon a dusty cardboard box filled with old
                VHS tapes. Most were blank or home-recorded movies, but one stood out. The tape had no proper label — just a
                yellowed strip of masking tape with shaky handwriting that read:
                "DO NOT WATCH."
        
                She chuckled. Somebodys idea of a prank, she thought.
        
                That evening, curiosity got the better of her. She set up her old VHS player, inserted the tape, and pressed
                play. Static hissed, followed by eerie black-and-white footage of dense woods swaying under a strong wind. The
                camera was handheld and shaky, as if someone were being chased.
        
                After a few minutes, the scene cut to a dilapidated wooden cabin. Whispering filled the room as the camera
                zoomed toward the broken window. Inside, Amelia saw a pale figure staring out — eyes wide, mouth unnaturally
                stretched, with black fluid leaking from its sockets.
        
                The screen glitched violently before flashing the message:
                "YOUR TURN."
        
                Then the screen went black.
        
                The room around her grew ice-cold. The TVs reflection flickered even though it was off. A faint knock came from
                the front door. She froze. The knocking grew louder, faster, then suddenly stopped.
        
                Amelia tiptoed to the peephole — nothing was there.
        
                But when she turned back, muddy footprints now trailed from the door to her bedroom. A low hum filled the
                apartment, followed by distorted whispering. Her TV flickered back to life, now showing live footage — of her
                apartment — with her standing exactly where she was. On the screen, behind her, a tall, faceless silhouette
                loomed.
        
                The lights burst. The shadow lunged. Cold, bony fingers wrapped around her neck as her vision blurred. The last
                thing she saw before losing consciousness was her own terrified face staring back from the TV screen.
        
                The next day, the apartment was empty. Only the tape remained, sitting neatly on the floor, its label now
                updated:
        
                "NEXT."
        
                Some say the tape continues to surface — passed from victim to victim — spreading its curse to anyone foolish
                enough to watch.</p>
